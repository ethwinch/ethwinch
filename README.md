ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @ethwinch (he/they)

I'm interested in Cybersecurity, all things Computer Science and have always had an interest in Game Development.
Some of my favorite games include Minecraft, Undertale/Deltarune, Overwatch and The Sims (specifically Sims 2 & 3).
I've been following the development of the upcoming indie game Paralives, and am super excited for the early access planned to release this year!

I've coded in Java, C++, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
I'm most comfortable in Python and C++, as well as HTML/CSS.

I'm also an artist! I mostly draw traditionally nowadays, but I'll ocasionally scan my traditional pieces and color them digitally.
Being able to see the world with both an analytical CompSci brain as well as a creative artistic brain has opened me up to a level of well-rounded understanding that not many people possess! 
I love working with both artists and computer scientists :)
