ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @ethwinch (he/they)

I focus on creating programs that are useful to the average person and account for the different ways people interact with technology. Age, disability, and what technology we've been exposed to early on in life have an immense impact on how we use new & current technology. Having taught a computers class for kids from K-8th grade, I have seen what they find frusterating and what is intuitive. Anyone who has helped their grandparent with an app on their iPad is aware of just how different older generations navigate & understand technology. By understanding how to appeal to both young & old demographics, we can create programs that are seamless to use and serve a larger number of people. Disabled people should not be left out of online spaces and technology due to a failure to implement accessability features.

My goal is create programs and designs that are intuitive for anyone to use, regaurdless of age or ability.
