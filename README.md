ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @ethwinch (he/they)

I'm interested in Cybersecurity, all things Computer Science and have always had an interest in Game Development.
Some of my favorite games include Minecraft, Undertale/Deltarune, Overwatch, Colorful Stage, and The Sims (specifically Sims 2 & 3).
I've been following the development of the upcoming indie game Paralives, and am super excited for the early access planned to release this year!

I mostly code in C++, Python, & HTML/CSS.

I strive to create well thought out programs that consider the variety of ways people interact with technology across different ages and abilities in both design and function.
